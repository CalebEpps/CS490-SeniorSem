8
Open Initial Commit
Create Android Studio Project
Ensure Everyone is Synced Up

9
Flesh Out Android Studio UI
Begin Writing Python

10
Continue Working on Model Code
Write methods for visualization (loss visualization, etc)

11
Start Initial Model Training
Experimentation with epochs, LR
Decide epochs for training

12
Discuss model optimizations
Continue retraining Model
Tweak epochs, lr as needed
Finalize epoch count
Finish training model

13
Start working with model in AS
Complete Android App
Done for C Grade
Work with Add. Models

14
Code Cleanup
Code Optimization
Work with Add. Models
Use *args/**kwargs for epochs, etc
Done for B Grade

15
Finalize Additional models (linear + additional CNN)

16
Breathe
Finalize Additional models
Finalize ALL A & B Requirements
